# Decadal Analysis of Nonlinear Internal Waves in the South China Sea Using Seafloor Instrumentation and Satellite

## Research summary
- Ocean-bottom pressure measurements reveal variations in local sea state
- Seafloor instrumentation can measure pressure changes related to nonlinear internal waves and be used to observe wave period and amplitude changes over time, which cannot be obtained from satellite imagery
- Geostationary satellite imagery can monitor decadal-scale variations, or lack thereof, in nonlinear internal wave propagation speeds and arrival directions
- Integrating observation methods reveals nonhydrostatic processes influencing seafloor pressure signals
